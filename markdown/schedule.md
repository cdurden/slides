| 03-30-2020   | [EfficientlySolvingInequalities] | I can solve inequalities by solving a related equation and then checking which values are solutions to the original inequality. | |
| 03-31-2020   | Solutions to Inequalities in One Variables| I understand that the solution to an inequality is a range of values (such as x>7) that make the inequality true. | 
| 04-01-2020   | Reasoning about Inequalities     | I can solve one-variable inequalities and interpret the solutions in terms of the situation.
